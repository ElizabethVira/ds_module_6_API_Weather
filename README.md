# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6
    In this exercise you will find information about around 500 cities obtained from two websites "Geocoding API and Weather API", to complete this assignment we have to complete two processes: 
    The first part to create a database that relates cities and climate (wind, humidity, cloudiness) with latitude and longitude starting from the equator and the second part use the first part to create a vacation plan cities. 
    All of the above with the use of different functions previously learned in the Jupyter notebook, using Python, Pandas and API, all this to analize the data with leaderboards and visualizations like:
        - Scatter plot
        - Linear regression scatter plot
        - Map plot
    By using all the data to create the leaderboards and visualizations, it is easier to understand the connection between two variables like localization and weather.
    As we progress through the exercise, you will find very useful use of API keys and connections to websites.

    NOTE: The images of the map plots for "Cities" and "Hotels" reside in the output_data folder, the size of the plots are to big to read on github.
